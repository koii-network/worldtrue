# WorldTrue: A Collaborative Truth-Seeking Platform

## Vision

We envision a world where everyone can work towards agreeing with everyone, from a common map, with a common vision of love, unity, and friendship, in the pursuit of the unknown.

In this pursuit of our shared vision of the world, we expect that there will be disagreements, and we expect that these disagreements will be solved in a civil fashion, and with love, as we are all seekers of the greater truth. This is our purpose.

## Our Mission

WorldTrue is building a collaborative platform where humanity can collectively map historical events, cultural elements, and engage in constructive discourse to find common ground and shared understanding.

## Core Pillars

### 1. Historical Consensus Building
We seek to find agreement on events throughout history and place them on a comprehensive map of the world throughout time. This creates a shared foundation of understanding about our collective past.

### 2. Cultural Context Integration
We identify and attach cultural elements, perspectives, and narratives to historical events, recognizing that truth is often multi-faceted and enriched by diverse viewpoints.

### 3. Safe Discourse Platform
We provide a transparent, unbiased space for individuals to engage in meaningful discourse, supporting the continuous refinement of our collective understanding through respectful dialogue.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js deployed to GitHub Pages
- **AI Integration**: AI agents assist in research, data population, and moderation
- **Future Decentralization**: Koii Network's community compute platform

## Governance Model

### Phase 1: Curated Administration
